# Description

The [NVIDIA Frameview app](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/technologies/frameview/) includes an SDK that allows programmatic access to the same information the app displays. It is rather sparsely documented, but might serve as a source for frametime and GPU hardware data.

# Documentation

- [FrameView beta user's guide](https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/GeForce/technologies/frameview/FrameView_Beta_User_Guide.pdf)
- [FrameView release notes](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/technologies/frameview/release-notes/)

# SDK

The FrameView app installer also installs an SDK and some pre-built binaries into `C:\Program Files\NVIDIA Corporation\FrameViewSDK`. The contents of the SDK directory next to this README are copied directly from `C:\Program Files\NVIDIA Corporation\FrameViewSDK\SDK`.
